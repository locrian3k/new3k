        <p>
          At one unknown point in the past, a universal anomaly formed of primordial energy
          pierced the dimension of 3Kingdoms. The resulting cataclysmic eruption of force
          caused a ripple effect, effectively copying the base universe of 3Kingdoms itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This massive upheaval resulted in a new dimension, named forth by the gods as
          <span class="scapes-highlight">3Scapes</span>!
        </p>
        <p>
          3Scapes is an alternative dimension to 3Kingdoms, similar in many respects, but
          completely unique in so many ways. Communication across the dimensions is easily
          handled, and you can retain your character identity across both worlds, but beyond
          that, everything else is distinct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since opening in <span class="scapes-highlight-blue">2009</span>, 3Scapes has grown
          to become a vibrant virtual community with new guilds, new areas, new quests, and
          new functionality. With its own cast of players, administrators, and its own unique
          feel, 3Scapes is ready for you to explore and enjoy!

          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-explosion"></i> The Cosmic Event</h3>
          <p>
            When the dimensional rift occurred, it didn't just copy the physical world - it
            created an entirely new timeline. The town of Pinnacle became
            <strong>Foundation</strong>, serving as the central hub for adventurers in this
            parallel realm. The three realms of Fantasy, Science, and Chaos exist here too,
            but have evolved along their own unique paths.

        <div class="origin-block">
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-code-branch"></i> Divergent Evolution</h3>
          <p>
            While 3Scapes shares its origins with 3Kingdoms, the two worlds have grown in
            different directions. New areas have been created exclusively for 3Scapes, guilds
            have developed unique features, and the community has forged its own identity.
            What was once a mirror has become a distinct world unto itself.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="origin-block">
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-users"></i> A Growing Community</h3>
          <p>
            Over the years, 3Scapes has cultivated its own dedicated player base. Many
            adventurers call both dimensions home, while others have found their permanent
            residence in this parallel world. The community continues to grow, welcoming
            new explorers ready to carve their own path.

          <h4>No Quest Sharing</h4>
          <p>
            Unlike 3Kingdoms, quest information cannot be shared between players. Every
            adventurer must discover the secrets and solutions on their own, making each
            quest completion a true personal achievement.
          </p>

          <h4>Foundation, Not Pinnacle</h4>
          <p>
            The central hub city is called Foundation - a reimagined version of Pinnacle
            that serves as the crossroads for all three realms and the starting point for
            new adventurers.

            3Scapes features areas, quests, and content found nowhere else. Explore

            With no quest info sharing, the puzzles and mysteries of 3Scapes remain

            determination.
