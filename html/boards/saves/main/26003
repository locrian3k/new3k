 
  I found this somewhat interesting...
 
 
  "What rankles Frenchmen is the decline of France relative to 
  other European countries. France wants to be not a world power 
  but the foremost European nation. If the present fuel debacle 
  brings about a decline of Western Europe, France wants to make 
  sure that it ends up sitting on top of the heap. To solve the 
  fuel problem by force would result in a situation in which 
  France could not play a paramount role. Hence, France will urge 
  submission to Arab dictates. It will also be for the abandonment 
  of Israel and the cold-shouldering of the United States."
