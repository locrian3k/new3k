  Hmm... well, one of my favorite soundtracks doesn't quite fit into the 
  trend going on here... but here goes anyway.  I like the soundtrack to The 
  Matrix a lot.  It's perfect right before we hit a sparring class. :} 
 
  On the whole, though, I prefer musicals to movie soundtracks.  I usually 
  listen to music that helps energize, rather than calm me down, because I 
  usually listen to music in my car.
