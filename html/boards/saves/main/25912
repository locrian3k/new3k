    I love soundtracks.  Ever since I became hopelessly addicted to
    Peter Gabriel's "Passion", I've searched for the best out there.
    I found one.
   
    Frank Herbert's "Children of Dune" soundtrack (tv miniseries).  It's
    a beautiful mix between "Passion" and "The Lord of the Rings".  Please
    don't pirate copies of it... you simply rob the composer (Brian Tyler).
   
    If you want to listen to a few sample tracks, head on over to Amazon.
    Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
