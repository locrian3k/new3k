 <p align="left">When tired with the everyday stress of the regular mud, nothing 
   spells relief like cold-hearted blood and killing. Players group 
   together in clans behind their respective leaders, and when 
   the votes tally up, declare an all out war on each other, battling 
   in a variety of voted on arenas and climaxing with a grand finale 
   inside a bloodcavern, a one room arena with no doors and no 
   escape. But unlike player killing, you lose nothing. Clanworld 
   has no effect on your character for the regular mud(other than 
   perhaps socially).</p>
 <p align="left">If you are interested in joining a clan, come to the Clan Room 
   just north of login and post your request to become involved. 
   Another good way is to contact a Clan Leader or Clan Recruiter 
   directly, especially if you know them through your own guild.
