  i think i recently saw one of those complilation cd's for sale on tv called 
  Mullet Rock. You might wanna do a search for that and see what's on it. 
 
  If that doesnt work, seek out the legendary Belt of Foreigner. You can get 
  this item buy winning enough times at skee ball and cashing in the tickets.
