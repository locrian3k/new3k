  Just testing the waters here, but as I'm OMPing this year, Im thinking of 
  where I might head during my travels in the States.  So far all I have 
  really planned is arrive (probably in San Francisco), spend some time in 
  Chicago, and Pittsburgh. 
 
  I'll be in the States for about two weeks all up, and I'm not exactly 
  certain whether after the OMP if I head to New York or just back to San 
  Francisco, but if you have any suggestions for me, or live in one of these 
  areas already and would like to meet up, send me a mail and I'll continue 
  my planning.
