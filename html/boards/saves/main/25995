  It amazes me today's teenagers hate the 80's as much as I
  despised the 70's.  I mean, how could you not like the 80's?
  We had upbeat music, bright happy colored clothing, culture
  that, for once, embraced homosexuality (Boy George, George Michael,
  any mamber of the New Kids on the Block, etc).
 
  Things were happening.  But, they just don't see it that
  way.  I'm rather looking forward to 10 years down the
  road when they look back on their HS pictures and
  finally realize that 98% of girls do NOT look good
  in low-cut jeans.
