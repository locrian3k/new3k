Simon tells you: I think the essence of the divergence with 3s was
       twofold, one was infinite alts, and the second was a "higher order
       endgame" (which has been diverged severely due to changes on both
       ports).
Simon tells you: Today I think it's the infinite alts but also
       quicker-to-end-game-content. Usually 100-150 combat days gets you
       to the 95% of the guild and most of the mud access.
Simon tells you: Oh also we have tiers (and rumors about generations) here
Note: tiers begin when you reach 150
Simon tells you: Hmmmm somewhat but very different. Basically as you use
       xp to level you access to buying talent points that you can spend
       on increasing your tier-talents.
Simon tells you: Like more professions, stats, stat max, regen, skill
       points, etc.
