  I would say the soundtrack from Shine rocks the house. The people playing 
  these particular classical masterpieces are just absolutely amazing. If 
  you've ever played the piano before it would help. I forget her name, but 
  Misha something or other played the hungarian rhap by rach the best Ive 
  ever heard it. Shrug, good musak
