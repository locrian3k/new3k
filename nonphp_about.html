							colossal realms beckon you to explore their mysteries.
						</p>

						<p>
							These kingdoms are known as:

							realm full of orcs, elves, dragons, and other mythical creatures;
							<strong class="text-science">Science</strong>, a post-apocalyptic,
							war-torn world set in the not-so-distant future; and
							<strong class="text-chaos">Chaos</strong>, a transient realm where
							the enormous realities of Fantasy and Science collide to produce
							creatures so bizarre that they have yet to be categorized.

						<!-- FAQ Item -->
						<div class="faq-item faq-item-chaos">
							<h3 class="faq-title">What exactly is the game?</h3>
							<p class="faq-text">
								Well, 3Kingdoms (or "3K" if you will) is a text-based adventure.
								If you've been around a while, think of games such as Zork or
								Adventure. In 3K, you "read" the world as you play and interact
								with it, using thousands of intuitive verb commands. Want to
								wield that sword you just found? You would enter "wield sword".
								Want to take a closer look at that desk in the secret room you
								just found? You would enter "examine desk" and then maybe follow
								up with "search desk" for a closer look. To help you out in the
								game, all you need to do is type "help" to give you access to
								3K's expansive help files. Beyond that, the same files are
								available online <a href="/help/index.php">right here</a> if you
								ever need them.
							</p>
						</div>

						<!-- FAQ Item -->
						<div class="faq-item faq-item-science">
							<h3 class="faq-title">
								Text? You're kidding me - I want graphics!
							</h3>
							<p class="faq-text">
								There are all kinds of games nowadays where you can get a fancy
								wrapper around a basic game concept, but we can give you
								something they cannot. We can guarantee you that the world you
								experience on 3Kingdoms will be uniquely <em>yours</em>. Why?
								Think about why the book is always better than the movie. Your
								imagination is the key. That dragon you see in your head will
								<em>always</em> beat out the one that some game developer drew
								up in Photoshop.
							</p>
						</div>

						<!-- FAQ Item -->
						<div class="faq-item faq-item-fantasy">
							<h3 class="faq-title">
								So, Multiplayer? What do you mean exactly?
							</h3>
							<p class="faq-text">
								We mean just that. You are sharing 3Kingdoms with a vibrant
								community of real people all around the world, with dozens to
								over a hundred players online at any given time. Now, not
								everyone is on at the same time - we all have real lives right?
								Rest assured, they will be back in a few hours to join you in
								your adventures. You'll meet them, trade with them, join guilds
								with them and down the road, go out on exciting adventures with
								them. The community is what really sets 3K apart, and you too
								can be part of it.
							</p>
						</div>

						<!-- FAQ Item -->
						<div class="faq-item faq-item-chaos">
							<h3 class="faq-title">
								Didn't someone mention somewhere that this can be played from
								work?
							</h3>
							<p class="faq-text">
								Yes, easily. Being text-based, you don't need anything more than
								basic telnet to play, meaning you can keep it secret from the
								boss. Of course, you'll eventually want to upgrade to a more
								robust gaming client down the road, but even some of these have
								strategically designed "boss buttons" that will instantly hide
								the game should you find the need.
							</p>
						</div>

						<!-- FAQ Item -->
						<div class="faq-item faq-item-science">
							<h3 class="faq-title">
								Ok, you referred to the 3K 'community' up there? What's that all
								about?
							</h3>
							<p class="faq-text faq-text-multi">
								3K is a sort of family, albeit a very large one. Many of our
								players have been around for years, and some even longer than
								that. That's the beauty of 3K. Not only does the game change,
								develop and grow, but so does the community as new people arrive
								to join our family.
							</p>
							<p class="faq-text">
								Additionally, being that 3Kingdoms is a vast community of many
								real people, there have been many opportunities for those people
								to meet beyond the game. From individual couples "hooking up" on
								their own, to annual, 3K sponsored,
								<a href="/omp.php">Official Mud Parties</a> (OMP's), many of the
								gamers have come to be good friends with other people in real
								life. In fact, there have even been marriages that have resulted
								from people meeting on 3Kingdoms. No kidding!

								Guilds
							</h3>
							<p>
								During your exploration of the realms, you have the opportunity
								to join any of our fantastic guilds. These guilds, like the
								Necromancers, the Juggernauts, the Knights, the Breed and many
								others, allow you to become part of a group and gives you a
								place to socialize with hundreds of other players that share
								your interests. Guilds also grant you unique, special powers,
								furthering your abilities as you explore the vast expanses of
								each realm. Beyond that, the guilds are massively developed
								entities unto themselves. You may even find yourself so immersed
								in the guilds themselves, that you may not even leave the guild
								halls...nah, you'll get out there and have all kinds of fun in
								the realms too.

								Quests
							</h3>
							<p>
								To challenge you, 3Kingdoms offers you the chance to complete
								wondrous quests, not unlike the legendary Quest for the Holy
								Grail. These quests, scattered throughout the realms (and even
								across them in some cases), tax your intellect as you attempt to
								solve puzzles, find hidden items, explore dank caverns, and even
								take on mighty foes to complete the quest and receive the
								treasured prize. Quests range from simple tasks that take mere
								minutes to solve, to the most expansive ones that may take you
								months to complete.

						<div class="detail-block">
							<h3 class="detail-title">

								Missions
							</h3>
							<p>
								Throughout your adventures, you'll encounter NPCs and creatures
								offering missions (brief tasks marked by a question mark beside
								their name). These dynamic assignments provide immediate rewards
								including coins, experience points, stat boosts, and reputation
								increases with various factions. Mission objectives vary from
								hunting specific creatures to gathering rare items from
								dangerous territories. When you spot that telltale question
								mark, type "mission help" to discover the available commands and
								embark on your first assignment. Unlike lengthy quests, missions
								offer quick, rewarding diversions that complement your ongoing
								adventures.
