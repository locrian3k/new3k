  I grabbed that one pretty early in my soundtrack hunting days.  It 
  has wonderful potential, but "Last of the Mohicans" seems to lack
  a level of complexity I enjoy.  It has a wonderful central
  theme... and everything else on that CD is just _slight_ 
  variations of that theme.  
 
  I'm not saying it's a bad one; it just doesn't conform to 
  my taste.  I appreciate the suggestion though....:)
