  Ok, it's happened to me a few times, Zorprime at least twice, and
  Crimson at least once.  You're adventuring merrily along, when all
  of the sudden, *poof*, you are in the login room.
 
  Has anyone else experienced this?  Because if you have, I'd like to
  find out what similar circumstances we all had and present it to someone
  who could possibly do something about it...as nice as it was to get
  a free port to town, it was not when I wanted it.
