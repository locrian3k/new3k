  Ok, pretty much half the mud remembers the Mullet's heyday.  I'm trying to 
  put together a CD or two with basically the ultimate in Mullet Rock music.  
  Its for a gift, and I was never much into that kind of music (I thought 
  Kool and the Gang was BS back then).  Any ideas? (other than therapy for 
  the Kool and The Gang thing) 
 
  Thanks 
 
  Cord.
