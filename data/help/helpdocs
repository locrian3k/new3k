file: /cmds/mortal/acopy.c
keywords: mortal, color, ansivars, setcolor, aset
aliases: 
short: ACopy - ANSI Variable Copy
header: Topic: ANSI Copy

  SYNTAX:  acopy <who> <<ansivar> | all>

This command allows you to copy the ANSI variables from one of your own
alternate characters to yourself. You cannot copy variables from another
player that isn't one of your alts. This copy includes both the prefix,
suffix, and whether you have it set to default, partial, or full coloring.

The syntax allows for two options:

acopy <who> <ansivar> - Copies *only* <ansivar> from <who>.
  NOTE: This copies the prefix, suffix, and partial setting. You cannot
        specify just the prefix or suffix using this command.

acopy <who> <all> - Copies *all* ansivars from <who>.

It is important to note that regardless of which format you use, it will
not copy guild ANSI unless *both* characters are in that guild. This is
to help prevent having to store ANSI for guilds that a character is not in.

header: Command: Advance
:::::::::::::::::::::::
    Topic: advance
hicyan::::::::::::::::::::::::

  Syntax: advance [which]

You can advance your level or any of your stats with this command
provided you have the available experience to do so.  This command
with no argument will attempt to raise your level by 1.  Alternatively,
you can advance your strength, dexterity, wisdom, constitution,
intelligence, or charisma.  You need only specify the first 3 letters
of each to increase it.  Such as: advance dex

Also, this command is used to advance any of your default skills.  These
skills can be seen via the 'skills' or 'mskills' commands.
To advance a skill, the full skill tree must be specified.  For example:
  advance combat.weapons.sword
Would advance your sword skill by 1 level.

You may also RESET your skills using : 'advance skill reset'
This costs money and it will tell you how much when you type it, giving
you a chance to change your mind.  The more often you reset, the more
expensive it becomes.

You can also reset your skills either fully or just untrain one individual
skill with no coin cost through usage of a VAF enhancement 'help vaf'

Once you've read this help file, and the help file on skills, send Cancer
a tell with the phrase alluded to by the underlined letters in each file.

file: /cmds/mortal/ansi.c
keywords: mortal, color, ansivars, setcolor, aset, acopy
aliases: 
short: Lions and tigers and Ansi -- OH MY!
header: Topic: Ansi

  SYNTAX:  see below

Three Kingdoms now has color that can be used by players if they
so desire.  It is also fully configurable by each and every player.
This is done with two commands: 'ansi' and 'aset'.

NOTE: Instead of using aset you can also use 'setcolor'which
uses the exact same syntax and does the exact same thing.
Also, 'mudansi' can be substituted for the 'ansi' command.

If you wish to use color the first thing you will need to do is
type 'ansi on'.
The ansi command supports the following syntax:

ansi on          Enables configurable ansi.  If it is disabled
                 none of your ansi settings will be used but they
                 aren't lost.  They're still saved and will be
                 used as soon as you type ansi on.
ansi full        This is just like ansi on except the entire line(s)
                 are coloured.  Not just part of it.
ansi off         Disables configurable ansi settings.  This is
                 useful if you find yourself on a terminal that
                 doesn't support ansi.  Instead of wiping all your
                 settings merely disable them instead.
ansi wipe        Removes ALL of your ansi settings
ansi default     Installs the default color scheme
ansi colors      Display all your standard colors, what they look
                 like on your monitor and what their settings are.
                 These colors can be used with the set command
                 (see below).
ansi fix         Restores color settings (not your configurable aset
                 variables) to their ANSI default
ansi <color>     Shows the value of a specific color.
ansi <col> <val> Changes the value of one of you standard colors.
                 Red or whatever may have a different value on your
                 terminal so this can be useful.

Certain commands and output has been specifically set up to be
colored.  This is done by setting certain variables.  Variables
go in pairs.  There is always a prefix variable and a suffix
variable.  The prefix variable is used to turn color on and the
suffix is used to turn it off.  Prefix variables end in _pref (eg
tell_pref) and suffix variables end in _suff (eg tell_suff).

On most peoples terminals the color 'reset' will turn off ansi.  If
not I suggest you find out what code does and then type 'ansi reset
<code>.  Please direct any comments, bug reports or problems to Raven.

	          	  yet.
	-showdirs	: Only display the area number and associated
	          	  directory paths.

You can also combine args, eg:

'arealist of:chaos by:mischief -unfixed' would list all areas in
Chaos that were coded by Mischief and aren't yet fixed.

'id' can match anything from the area's name, realm or coders or
unique id. eg. 'arealist cave' would list any areas with the string
'cave' in their name, while 'arealist mos' would list anything coded
by Mosiah, or Mos, or anything that happened to have 'mos' somewhere
in its name.

file: /cmds/mortal/botcheck.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Command: botcheck <person/SHOW/key>
 e.g.:  botcheck rastafan
        botcheck ab+5!y

So, it's the middle of the night, and someone has stolen your kill
for the eleventieth time and is not responding to tells.  You're
almost certain they're botting but no wizards are around (amirite?)
This is your chance to have it checked yourself.  You can 'botcheck'
another player.  If they FAIL that botcheck, you can be sure the
wizards have noticed and will intervene.  However, if they are just
ignoring you and not botting, you'll get the talking to for being
impatient and/or annoying.

If you've been botchecked, you can make it go away by typing the
keyword that's been shown to you using 'botcheck <keyword>'
Someone cannot be botchecked when already botchecked.
You cannot botcheck more often than every 20 minutes.
If botchecked, you have 15 minutes to do something about it.
If you cannot read your keyword, you can 'botcheck SHOW' to have it
displayed again, differently.

The keyword has no uppercase characters in it, even if it looks like it.

You should really try to validate, through tells or other means, if a
person really isn't around before using this command.  Although the
command is anonymous to the receiver, you are logged for the wizards.
A botcheck is received as a 'tell' and does show up in your tell history.

file: /cmds/mortal/brief.c
keywords: mortal, movement, look, glance
aliases: 
short: Adjusts your brief/mapping exploration settings
header: Topic: Brief

  SYNTAX:  brief

This command allows you to choose what you see as you walk around 3Kingdoms.
There are two facets to this command, brief and mapping...

Brief   : Controls whether you see the Short (one-liner) or Long (verbose)
on/off    descriptions of rooms.

Mapping : Controls whether or not you see the cardinal minimap.  This map
yes/no    is displayed in the right side of your screen and starts out as
          a basic display of exits from your current room.  As you gain
          more skill in cartography ('help adventuring.cartography'), this
          automated minimap becomes much more useful, showing surrounding
          rooms, exits and even monsters and other players in the vicinity.
          You should also check out 'help lineofsight' for more creamy
          mapping goodness.

To adjust your pesonal settings, choose one of the following...
  'brief'          - displays your current brief settings
  'brief on yes'   - brief mode on, yes show the mapping
  'brief off yes'  - brief mode off, yes show the mapping
  'brief on no'    - brief mode on, no don't show the mapping
  'brief off no'   - brief mode off, no don't show the mapping

Note: Regardless of your brief setting, you can still always look at
      the long description of a room via the 'look' command.  Whether
      or not you see the minimap at this time will depend on your
      mapping setting being yes or no.

Note: Regardless of your brief setting, monsters, players and objects
      in the room will still be displayed.

Note: Be careful when exploring new areas in brief mode, you will most
      likely miss many interesting (and potentially dangerous) things.

Using a complex set of heuristics and cutting edge algorithms derived in
part from antivirus scanning software and some code supplied by a Google
employee, cheatwho analyzes command patterns and frequencies to deduce
which currently logged in player is most likely cheating. While no
automated system can ever be perfectly accurate, testing has shown cheatwho
to be very reliable in assessing a likely target, which then could be 
followed up with a botcheck of the suspect.

file: /cmds/mortal/clhelp.c

syntax: clhelp [file] [delay] [chunk size]

Copies help from the mud to the Portal.  It doesn't put the file
anywhere until you choose to save it to the autotyper or a local file
within the Portal.

 PLEASE NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE CLIENT VERSION 2.0 OR GREATER TO USE THIS COMMAND.

All downloaded files may be accessed through the little blue jewel on
your main output screen.  It's in the upper left corner.

If you wish to provide delay or chunk size you must also provide
all the preceding arguments as well.

Delay is a number of CPU cycles to wait between each line.  A high
value in this will crap out cled from Too many Eval cycles.  This
argument is only useful if you have a really bad connection or other
such issues.

Chunk size is the # of lines you wish the mud to send at a time.  The
default is 200, the minimum is 50.  Set this lower if you have a bad
connection.  It is not advised to set it above 200.


--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/coins.c
keywords: VAF, funds, basic, mortal, sc, score
aliases: coin, coins, bank, currency, cash, money
short: The status of 3K's mud economy
header: Topic:  Coins and Money
syntax: coins

The standard currency in the three kingdoms (and newbieland) is the
gold coin.  All of the major shops across the lands will gladly take
it, and reluctantly give it back when you sell items.  When you die,
all of the coins you were carrying are left with your corpse.  Thus
as you accumulate coins, you may wish to store some in the bank.  For
more information on the banking system, visit the main bank just north
of the center of town.

As of February, 03, 1999, it was finally agreed by the admin that
the state of money on this mud had become absurd.  Players
were walking around with over a hundred MILLION coins.  A
lot of players have 10s of millions of coins.  This pretty
much blows a hole in any possible mud economy.

Now, here's the sticky part.  Logic doesn't fit all that well
in every aspect of a mud.  But here's one spot that we felt
was a necessary addition (at least to a point).  Money now
has a weight to it.  This means to carry a large sum of
coins you're going to have to give up carrying some other items.
To carry more money, you can buy money bags at a bank.
These will hold a lot of coins, offsetting the weight a bit.

The largest impact that was made is that banks now have a maximum
account balance.  100 million coins in a bank account is silly,
no banker in his right mind wouldn't steal that and leave town.
The bank account maximum for all players is 10,000 coins times that
player's level.  On top of this, high mortals may store an extra 
250,000 coins in their bank accounts.  People who offer 3K voluntary 
access fees may be entitled to a greater bank account maximum.

For you guilds that are MONEY dependent (cybers for instance),
your guild GMs will provide additional means of storing and or
amassing coins for wares and similar necessities.  The rest of
you are going to have to make do.

Addendum:  Several months after the money change, the quantities of
           money have reduced to respectable levels.  Therefore, the
           ADMIN have decided to slowly increase the maximum.  The max
           will never allow the same ridiculous levels as before, but it
           will slowly increase every week.  Use the "balance" command
           at an ATM to check your personal limit.

The 'coins' command will show you how many coins you are currently
carrying on you, and how many coins you have in the bank.  If you have
any means of carrying additional coins from your guild, those will not
show up.

Incidentally, the size of a pile of gold coins logically increases as
the number of coins in it increases.  Below we list for you the basic
progression for the more common coin amounts -- if you find anything
that is not listed, you have found quite a fortune indeed!

A single gold coin.
A couple gold coins.
A few gold coins.
A bunch of gold coins.
A tiny stack of gold coins.
A small pile of gold coins.
A pile of gold coins.
A large pile of gold coins.
A really large pile of gold coins.
A humongous pile of gold coins.

Because so many players have inquired, we will state it herein:    you
are able to 'drop <#> coins' to free some carrying capacity.

header: Command : Dungeons

Syntax: dungeons [player/directive]

This command allows you to see all the dungeons that you are currently
saved to, the boot you're saved until (inclusive), when you're allowed
to clear your ID (if at all), and the ID of the dungeon and any players
(currently online) that are saved with you.  

You will not be able to enter a dungeon area with players that are saved
to a different ID.  Similarly no one can enter your dungeon if they have
a different ID.  The only way to get the same dungeon ID as another
player is to party with them.  (Partying with players saved to various
different dungeon IDs will have interesting results...)

You can check the dungeons your party mates are saved to with:
  dungeons <player>
You can leave a dungeon group with:
  dungeons clear <name or ID/all>

Example output:
=========================================================================
------------------------- Boot Number:  873 -----------------------------
=========================================================================
- Dungeon                   : Boot# Can Reset   ID/With

- Death Taco                :   874 now         [8]
=========================================================================


Indicating that I'm saved to Smurfland through boot 873, unless I choose
To leave that dungeon ID earlier, which I can do in 1 hour and 47 minutes.
My dungeon ID for Smurfs is 15, and there's no other players online right
now that are saved with me.
My lock on Death Taco won't expire for a few more boots if I desire, but
I could leave that dungeon ID now if I wanted, if perhaps I was going
to party with someone else in that area who is also already saved.

as shown above, may be used to relate feelings and perform 'soul
commands' that are not already part of the mud.  Everybody in
the room will be able to see your emotes.

For example, typing in:
    emote looks at you and shivers in fright.

will display to the room:
   <Your name> looks at you and shivers in fright.

You can also emote just to yourself... for whatever reason, by adding
the word 'SELF' to the front, such as: emote SELF is lonely.

keywords: mortal, basic, i, mudeq
aliases: equipment
short: Shows what equipment you are wearing/wielding
header: Topic: Equipment

  Syntax:  eq | mudeq [-hide <what>]

The 'eq' command will show you what weapon you are wielding,
what armour you are wearing, and some of the armours you are
not wearing.  It's handy to use if you are interested in
equipment only, and not in the other things you carry.

If you are in a guild that does not allow you to wear a particular article
such as boots, you can now hide that article from the eq listing.

Example:
   eq -hide feet  :   Will hide any armour that is worn on the feet.
   eq -reset      :   Will reset eq listing to default setting.

You can customize the colours with 'setcolor <var> <colour>', where
<var> is one of:

  sc_text     : The text, like 'Wimpy:' and 'Exp :'
  sc_value    : All values in the score list, like '13'.

For example, 'setcolor sc_text yellow' will show you the text in the
list in a yellow color.  Provided you have 'ansi on', of course. :)
When you haven't specified a colour, eq will use its own default
colours.

short:  Get more information about a character
header: Topic: Finger

  SYNTAX:  finger <person>
           finger <level>
           finger

Without an argument this will show every character online in this realm, their
level, guild, gender, and pk status.  With arguments, it will only show the
character specified or characters of the specified level.

  Example: finger barnaby  (shows information about 'Barnaby')
  Example: finger 49       (shows all characters of level 49 logged in)

You can also use the alternative 'qf' command for a condensed version.

You will notice that, if applicable, the finger command also provides
you with information about character and their existence across realms.
Additionally, you are able to access finger information about a specific
character on a specific realm by using the following format:

  Example: finger barnaby@3k  (shows info about 'Barnaby' on realm 3k)

  SYNTAX:  fixmob <mob>

If you encounter a mob that won't die because it appears to be bugged out,
try this command on it before you notify a wizard. Sometimes they get
stuck in a half-dead state and this command should fix that. If it
fails to fix the issue, then please alert a wizard manually.

Usage of this command is logged for future debugging and to ensure it is
not used in a manner that is inappropriate. If anyone is found using this
for reasons other than stated, there will be consequences.

The 'flapchat' command will allow you to talk on the mudwide
chatline for general chatter.  It's blocked more often than shout and is

not a gripe line or a personal pedestal.  Respect the conversation and
please do not overuse it.
You can 'flapchat off' to never see it again.
You can also 'flapchat on' when you realize how much you miss it.
The content of this chat line should be rated 'PG' as per normal rules.

  SYNTAX:  follow <person>

This command starts you following someone until either:
   a) They lose you
   b) You stop following them

NOTE: If you have problems with this command PLEASE mail Rastafan.

***Things to keep in mind:

You cannot follow people through 'teleports'.  Some wizards code exits
that in effect 'teleport' you from one place to the next, although it may
seem like you just walked there, you didn't.  So, if ever you find that
you couldn't follow someone somewhere, it's probably because they were
teleported through the exit.

file: /cmds/mortal/friend.c
keywords: friends, wall
aliases:
short: Managing your Friend List
header: Friends Management
syntax: friend <optional arguments>

Use the 'friend' command to manage your friend list and the privacy
settings of your alternate characters.

Use this command in conjuntion with others listed at the end of this file.

Just like the name implies, your friends list is where you keep track of
your various friends and acquaintances here on 3-Kingdoms.  What does the
friends list offer that the older mywho doesn't?

  * Maintain a single list across all your characters
  * Members of your friends list are tied to the human, not the
    character - forget having to remember who all those alts belong to
  * Only allow the the alts you want to be visible - keep your secret
    characters secret
  * The same old functionality as mywho, to boot! (see stalking below)
  * Sync your current mywho list as stalkees
  * Post messages to your wall for others to see (help wall for details)

When you add a friend, they have to accept your friend request.
You will both show up on one another's lists, and will be able to see
any visible alternate characters of each others.

* See: friend hide/unhide below for details on alt visibility.

When you stalk someone, you add them to your list without their
knowledge.  You do not see any information about their other characters,
nor do you get other privileges of being their friend (like being able
to write on their wall, for instance).

    IMPORTANT: You will have 50 available spaces in your list for
    friends, and 50 available spaces for stalkees.

    See 'vaf friends' for information on how to increase the limit
    of your friends list.  Your stalkee limit will always be 50,
    regardless of any VAF perks.

    If you have previous mywho vaf selections, you can convert
    them to friends credits by typing 'vaf mywho2friends'.

friend <character/nickname>
  View details about a friend (their characters, etc), and/or any
  stalkees you have under the name.

friend add <character> <nickname>
  Send a request to someone, with <nickname> being the name you
  tie to the human and all of their characters.  Nicknames you supply will
  always be forced into lowercase.
  (example: friend add gothbunny bob)

  They will have 5 minutes to accept the request before it expires.
  If they accept in time, you become mutual friends!

friend remove <nickname>
  Sever your friendship with someone permanently.  You are of course
  free to reconnect with them again whenever you like.

friend rename <oldnickname> <newnickname>
  Change someone's nickname on your friends list.

friend stalk <character> <nickname>
  Unlike adding someone as a friend, the person you stalk will not see
  you add them to this list.  In turn, you will not be able to see what
  other characters this person has.  This is essentially the same
  functionality as mywho.

friend unstalk <character>
  Remove this character from your list of stalkees.

friend mywhosync
  Add everybody from your mywho list as stalkees.

friend hidden
  View which characters are hidden and which are visible.
  This will also show you which characters have private walls and 
  public walls.

friend hide <character>
  Hide one of your characters from being revealed as your alt.

friend unhide <character>
  Reveal one of your hidden characters as your alt.


--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/friends.c
keywords: friend, wall
aliases:
short: View your Friends List
header: Friends List
syntax: 'friends <optional arguments>' OR 'friends all'

View your list of friends.  There are many sorting and filtering
options available, which are described here.

Use this command in conjuntion with others listed at the end of this file.

Characters which have a * next to their name have new wall postings
that you have not read yet.  (see help wall for more details)

If no arguments are provided, the list will display:
  * both online and idle characters (no linkdead characters)
  * both friends and stalkees
  * sorted with unidle characters on top, and idle characters
    in order of descending idle time

friends all will display every character on your list, as
well as the time since they last logged in (compare to mywho2),
and are not affected by the filtering and sorting options described below.

:: Filtering Options ::

  online / on / o
  idle / i
  linkdead / ld / l
  friends / f
  stalking / s

:: Sorting Options ::

  nicknames / nickname / nicks / nick / n
  levels / level / lvls / lvl / lev
  guilds / guild / g

You are free to mix filtering and sorting options together, provided you
are not using multiple sorting options.

    IMPORTANT: You will have 50 available spaces in your list for
    friends, and 50 available spaces for stalkees.

    See 'vaf friends' for information on how to increase the limit
    of your friends list.  Your stalkee limit will always be 50,
    regardless of any VAF perks.

    If you have previous mywho vaf selections, you can convert
    them to friends credits by typing 'vaf mywho2friends'.

file: /cmds/mortal/get.c
keywords: mortal, take, basic, drop, keep, unkeep
aliases: 
short: Get an object in the room
header: Topic Get

  SYNTAX:  get <object> OR get all

The 'get' and 'take' commands allow the player to pick up items
from the ground, provided they are able to take on that much more
weight in their inventories.  Not all objects are able to be taken,
of course, for various reasons.

This command will also accept 'all' as an argument, and this will
cause you to attempt to pick up everything on the ground in front
of you.  Of course, weight is one of the considerations that would
prevent you from being able to take something.


--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/gguild.c
keywords: mortal, gguild

header: Command : gguild

   Syntax: gguild <message>

  SYNTAX:  give <object> to <monster or person>
     OR:  give all to <monster or person>

The 'give' command allows a player to give one object to a monster
or another player, provided the object is in fact droppable.  Some
objects(for instance, guild objects) are coded so that they cannot
be given away to others, for various reasons.

This command may also take 'all' as a first argument, which will
cause you to attempt to give all unkept items to the monster or
player in question.


--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/gladtalk.c
keywords: mortal, chatlines, communication, gladiators
aliases: 
short: Gladiator Chatline
header: Topic: Gladtalk

--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/glimpse.c
keywords: glimpse
aliases: 
short: Seeing into the next room
header: Command: glimpse

   Syntax:   glimpse <exit>

The glimpse command allows you to skillfully gain a quick peek into an
adjacent room.  You must have a high skill in Perception to be able to
use this ability, and the exertion to do so requires that you rest a
length of time before you can try again.  The length of the rest can be
reduced by having at least rudimentary skill in Evasion and Survival.

   Example

glimpse east
glimpse down

not cost any spell points to use.  This line may be toggled on

will not be tolerated, and may result in revocation of your gossip
line privleges, or worse.

Gossip Line Commands:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    gossip on   - subscribe to the gossip channel
    gossip off  - unsubscribe the gossip channel
    gossip who  - show whos listening to the gossip channel

keywords: mortal, basic, who, who2, hardcore, character, players
aliases: 
short:  See the list of hardcore players
header: Topic: Hardcore

  SYNTAX:  'hwho' or 'hardcore' [history [sort]]

This command shows the list of hardcore players currently logged on.
If you use the [history] argument, it will show a high level of detail about
every hardcore player that ever reached level 30.  You can sort by any of
the fields shown in the resultant output with the optional [sort] argument.
The default sort order is by # of hardcore kills, as defined as monsters
whose class is >= your hardcore kill class req (HCKCR) in the list.

Becoming a hardcore player
A player can ONLY choose to be hardcore when they are first created.
You cannot turn a regular character into a hardcore character nor vice-versa.
If a hardcore character dies just 1 time, you can no longer advance, leave
town, party, or gain XP.

Every player gets a single hardcore alternate slot for free.

Benefits of Hardcore Characters
When a hardcore character reaches level 30, all of that player's legal
alternate characters get a free skill point.  Those characters also gain
another point for every 5 levels beyond 30.  Only your highest level
hardcore character lends this benefit.  i.e. having more than one hardcore
character over level 30 won't give you extra skill points.

file: /cmds/mortal/help.c
keywords: mortal, basic, general, alias
aliases: index, keywords, menu, main menu
short: Three Kingdoms Help System
header: Topic:  Help Menu System

  SYNTAX:  help <optional toggle> <string argument>

Welcome to 3K's help system!

The universal helper system provides you with the ability to read
help files, search them by keyword or category, or list them in an index.

Here's how it works:

There are two ways of seeing all of 3K's help files.  For the novice or
for those who prefer less spam, you can type 'help', and you will see a menu
of 3K's help topic categories, and some directions on perusing help topics by
category.  If you prefer, you can type 'help -all' for a complete list of the
available help topics, sorted by category.  If you exclusively prefer this
method, you can save yourself a few keystrokes by aliasing 'help' to 'help -all'.
(see 'help alias' for more information)

Once you find an available topic, you may choose to 'help <topic>' to show
the detailed information about that topic.

Several toggles are available to make it easier to search for help topics.  The
complete list with descriptions and examples of using each follows.  Feel free
to try out the examples so you have an idea how things work:

client       Send a help file to the Portal autotyper (if used)
index        Access the help system indexing feature
search       Access the help system keyword feature
list         Access the help system category list feature

The index feature will help you find topics if you have only some idea
of what you're looking for.  Here are some examples:

help index s      -- lists all help files beginning with the letter 's'
help index shout  -- lists all help files beginning with 'shout'.
help index        -- lists an index of all help files, sorted by category.

The keyword feature will allow you to list topics associated with the
input keyword, along with a short description of what that topic is about.
Here are some examples:

help search rules      -- lists help files that have 'rules' as a keyword topic.
help search <category> -- lists help files that fall under the named category.

Most keywords are themselves help topics (also known as a 'SEE ALSO:'),
but there are several other 'logical' keywords that have been incorporated to
group similar help files together beyond having them keyword each other.

Depending on your wizard level, you may use any, some, or all of:
  help search lowwiz  - list all 'low wizard' topics (all wizards)
  help search fullwiz - list all 'full wizard' topics (level > 510)
  help search secure  - list all 'secure' topics (various levels)
  help search titled  - list all 'titled wizard' topics (lord+ only)
  help search admin   - list all 'admin wizard' topics (admin only)

Because you are a high mortal, you may use:
  help search highmort - list all 'high mortal' player topics

All players may use:
  help search mortal  - list all 'mortal' player topics

  help search communication - lists all such player topics

 All keywords that are themselves help topics will appear as a
'SEE ALSO:' at the bottom of the help output.  By using 'help search <topic>',
you may list the help topics that have been associated with that help topic.

The category list feature will list all help topics that fall under one of the
available categories (as listed when you type 'help' with no argument).
Recently, it was made so this command works with any available keyword as well.
Here some examples:

help list important  -- lists help files that are in the 'important' category.
help list mortal     -- lists help files that are in the 'mortal' category.

Some help topics belong to more than one category, so may show up more
than once.

PLEASE NOTE: For UNIX junkies and those more comfortable with UNIX switches,
You can use help -c, -i, -k, or -l as described for client/index/search/list
features above.

  Syntax: hmonitor s      (show all monitoring players)

This command allows your party members to monitor your HP and/or SP every

          hmonitor fred 50% 50%
          Fred will now see if either your HP or SP drop below 50%.

          hmonitor sally 2500 400
          Sally will see if your HP drops below 2500 or your SP below 400.

          hmonitor sally off
          Sally won't see your status any longer.

          hmonitor s
          Shows everyone you've set up to monitor and at which values.

command will display your current Hit Points and Spell Points.  If you are
a member of any guild other than Adventurers, likely there is additional
information available to be displayed on your hpbar.  Please check your
guild help files for more information on those stats.

   Syntax:   i <reverse|kept|unkept>

The inventory command will show you everything you are carrying.
Additionally, if you are wielding or wearing any items, this will
be indicated next to the item.  The last line will show you how much
of a burden your equipment is to you. Using the <reverse> argument
will flip the order things are listed (useful if you have a small
screen or it otherwise scrolls by too fast). Using <kept> or <unkept>
arguments will show you only items kept or unkept, respectively.

NOTE: You cannot see your inventory if you are in a dark room.

   Example:

>i

  ibrief              - Lists briefed items in your inventory.
  ibrief <arg>        - Toggles brief on <arg> in your inventory.

  ibrief all [on|off] - Toggles brief on/off for your entire inventory.
  ibrief needed <arg> - Logs an item that should allow briefing.

 ibrief will, on an item by item basis, block some/all messages 
 from the item to reduce your combat spam. Each item must be
 individually coded for this to work. If you find an item that does
 not support briefing but should, use 'ibrief needed <arg>' to tag
 the item for wizards to add the functionality to it.

 Note: Ibrief affects what *you* see and will not generally affect
       what is displayed to the room/others.

 Also note, dropping an item will reset its brief setting.

  must be placed after the item in question.                  

   Example

  When suggesting an idea for a room:                         
    idea Would be cool if I could write my name in the dust.  

  When suggesting an idea involving an item in your inventory:
    idea sword 2: Could you add ansi to the damage emotes?

of an item in your inventory to another player.  The item must
be in your inventory and not a container such as a bag, and the
player must be present.

file: /cmds/mortal/keep.c
keywords: mortal, basic, unkeep, give, drop
aliases: 
short: Keep an item
header: Command: Keep

   Syntax:	keep <item|all [equip | bound]>

Keep allows you to mark an item for keeping in your inventory.
This is especially handy when you are carrying a large number of
items and wish to perhaps sell off the majority to Cancer.  Using this
command you can 'keep' the items that you don't want to sell and then
'sell all' without fear of having to buy back your stuff.

You may choose to use the 'all' option to mark all items for
keeping.  You can also 'keep all equip', which will mark all
worn armours, as well as your wielded weapon as kept.

You may also 'keep all bound' to keep all equipment that is
currently bound to you.


   Example
      keep sword

--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/ktrig.c
keywords: mortal, basic, corpse
aliases: 
short: Set a kill trigger
header: Command: Ktrig

   Syntax:	ktrig <commands>

Usage of this command requires the 'ktrig1' vaf perk ('vaf ktrig1' for more)

This command allows you to set an action or set of actions to fire
when you kill the monster you are fighting.  Actions are separated by
a forward slash and you can have up to 3 with the 'ktrig1' vaf or 10 if
you also have the 'ktrig2' vaf perk.  In addition, you can use the
special character '$' in place of the corpse name itself so that you
are specifically targetting the corpse you just created (if any) by
killing this monster.

The ktrig of the player tanking is called first followed by the ktrig
of the player that got the killing blow (if different.)  You can change
when you want yours to fire by toggling off TANK or KBLOW if, for example,
you don't want your ktrig to fire on monsters you're not tanking.

Other options:  CLEAR, ON, OFF, TANK (toggles), KBLOW (toggles)
See also     :  (in a party) phelp ktrig

   Example

>ktrig get corpse/put corpse in bag

--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/lineofsight.c
keywords: mortal, look
aliases:
short: Line of Sight
header: Command: lineofsight
Coupled with a cartography skill of 3, this command allows you to see
surrounding rooms within your current line-of-sight.  Rooms (O) are shown
in a bird's eye mapping format with corresponding exits (^ = up, v = down,
+ = up+down, E = enter) as well as any players, monsters or npcs that may
happen to be in the area (not including your current room).  Your current
room appears as @ unless it has one of the specific exits noted above,
which will appear in yellow.

Even with lower cartography skills ('help adventuring.cartography') you
are able to passively view the cardinal minimap for each room you
encounter.  To fully utilize the ability while exploring (i.e. 'look'ing
or via the passive viewing of the long description of a room) you need
to have mapping enabled in your 'brief' settings ('help brief').
Also, typing 'lineofsight brief' will manually display the minimap.

Be aware that regardless of your skill level, some areas (?) and/or creatures
will be unable to be sighted, particularly guild followers.  Additionally,
assuming you have a light source, dark rooms (#) are viewable along your
line of sight, but you will find that the further the peer into the
darkness, the more powerful of a light source you will need to have.

short: How to make use of your eyes
header: Command: Look

   Syntax:   look at [what] <on ground | in room>
        or:   look

The look command allows you to examine your
environment.  The plain version 'look' gives
you a description of the room you are in.
You can specify 'on ground' if you are trying to look at an object
lying on the ground, such as a sword or monster.  This is useful if
there is a conflicting item in the room you can also look at.
You can specify 'in room' if you are trying to look at something that
is part of the room description and there's a conflicting item on the
ground.

With 'look at something', you can scrutinize
something more closely.

   Example

look at paper
look at sword 2
look at paper in room
look at paper on ground
look at potion 3 on ground

file: /cmds/mortal/medals.c
keywords: medals, medal
aliases: 
short: List awarded medals
header: Command: Medals
syntax: medals || medals <id> || medals <id> <who> || medals <block/show>
    There are many avenues in which a person may obtain a medal
  throughout the realms.  Some may be awarded through mundane
  tasks, such as killing an enemy of a certain denizen of 3K.
  Others may be awarded through quest like tasks; and yet some
  may be given without realizing it.

  Commands:
   medals          - Shows you the medals you've achieved and your
                     achievement point total
   medals show [s] - Shows all public medals and the point total, with

  areas of the realms by gaining the trust of those who award
  you with them.  Point being; you will have to figure out the
  rewards on your own.  Happy hunting!

    Note: 'medals block' will turn on/off your availability to
  view other's medals.  This will cut down on attempted spam.

    Note: You may only examine medals you possess or are shown.
  You may alternatively peruse the archives in Pinnacle and lookup
  awards gained by fellow adventurers.  Please note, there are two
  classifications.  Public and private.  You may only view private
  medals if you have gained possession of one, and only see it in
  someone else's lookup if you have both earned it.

--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/mudansi.c
keywords: mortal, color, ansivars, setcolor, aset, acopy
aliases: 
short: Setting ansi colors
header: Topic: Mudansi

   SYNTAX:  See Below

Three Kingdoms now has color that can be used by players if they
so desire.  It is also fully configurable by each and every player.
This is done with two commands: 'ansi' and 'aset'.

NOTE: Instead of using aset you can also use 'setcolor' which
uses the exact same syntax and does the exact same thing.
Also, 'mudansi' can be substituted for the 'ansi' command.

If you wish to use color the first thing you will need to do is
type 'ansi on'.  The ansi command supports the following syntax:

ansi on          Enables configurable ansi.  If it is disabled
                 none of your ansi settings will be used but they
                 aren't lost.  They're still saved and will be
                 used as soon as you type ansi on.
ansi full        This is just like ansi on except the entire line(s)
                 are coloured.  Not just part of it.
ansi off         Disables configurable ansi settings.  This is
                 useful if you find yourself on a terminal that
                 doesn't support ansi.  Instead of wiping all your
                 settings merely disable them instead.
ansi wipe        Removes ALL of your ansi settings.
ansi default     Installs the default color scheme
ansi colors      Display all your standard colors, what they look
                 like on your monitor and what their settings are.
                 These colors can be used with the set command
                 (see below).
ansi <color>     Shows the value of a specific color.
ansi <col> <val> Changes the value of one of you standard colors.
                 Red or whatever may have a different value on your
                 terminal so this can be useful.

Certain commands and output has been specifically set up to be
colored.  This is done by setting certain variables.  Variables
go in pairs.  There is always a prefix variable and a suffix
variable.  The prefix variable is used to turn color on and the
suffix is used to turn it off.  Prefix variables end in _pref (eg
tell_pref) and suffix variables end in _suff (eg tell_suff).

On most peoples terminals the color 'reset' will turn off ansi.  If not
I suggest you find out what code does and then type 'ansi reset <code>'.

Please direct any comments, bug reports or problems to Raven.

file: /cmds/mortal/mudeq.c
keywords: mortal, basic, i, eq, score, mi
aliases: 
short: Quick information on equipment
header: Command: Mudeq

   Syntax:	eq | mudeq

The 'eq' command will show you what weapon you are wielding,
what armour you are wearing, and some of the armours you are
not wearing.  It's handy to use if you are interested in
equipment only, and not in the other things you carry.  The
list of equipment is also colorized to indicate the general
condition of each piece of equipment.

You can customize the colours with 'setcolor <var> <colour>', where
<colour> is one of:

  sc_text     : The text, like 'Wimpy:' and 'Exp :'
  sc_value    : All values in the score list, like '13'.

For example, 'setcolor sc_text yellow' will show you the text in the
list in a yellow color.  Provided you have 'ansi on', of course. :)
When you haven't specified a colour, eq will use its own default
colours.

--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/mudlag.c
keywords: mortal, 
aliases: lag
short: Current driver load information
header: Command: Mudlag

   SYNTAX:  mudlag

The 'mudlag' command provides all sorts of useful information on
the status of the internal resources the mud is working with, and
the lag that is being generated by them.

The mudlag report is composed of the following:

Lag Average - The lag average is an objective quantity that
closely correlates with the delay between the time when
a user enters a command and when he gets a response from the
mud (sans any network delays).  The mud is supposed to have a
heart_beat every 2 seconds, but when the driver is under load,
the heart_beat is usually delayed.  The term 'lag' refers to
this delay time in seconds, and the 'lag average' is the average
heart_beat delay in the period during which it is measured.

CPU Usage - This is the percentage of CPU time that the mud
driver process was allotted by the system.  If it's high, the
mud driver is doing a lot of thinking.  If it's low, either
the mud driver just doesn'
t have much to think about or the CPU
is being allotted to some other process on the system and the
driver process is being forced to wait and share.  The latter
case would contribute to lag.

Driver Load - This shows the average number of commands from
users that the driver is processing every second (cmds/s),
and the average number of lines of LPC code that the driver
is compiling every second (lines/s).  The cmds/s varies
depending on the rate at which players are entering commands
and is limited by the rate at which the driver can process
those commands.  The lines/s correlates to the number of new
objects that the driver is loading into memory.  When the
mud is first booted, this number is very high because the
driver has to load every object in anew.  I don't know over
what period of time the averaging for these values is being
done.

Load Average - The first 3 numbers is the system load average.
It is the number of jobs in the run queue averaged over 1, 5
and 15 minutes respectively.  It indicates the level of
utilization of and competition for the CPU and other system
resources.

   Syntax:	nolife <player|ranking>

The Nolife list actually shows the players on 3K that need to
get a life (as a result of playing too much).  The list only
shows time for the past two weeks, and is updated every so
often after a player logs off.  Wizards are not included on
the nolife list, only players.  The usage is as following:

'nolife'
'nolife <number>'
'nolife <name>'


Typing 'nolife' alone will show the top ten nolife players.

Typing 'nolife 40' would show you the top 10 and 36-43 nolife players.

Typing 'nolife zorak' would show you the top ten nolife
players, the 4 nolife slots 'above' Zorak, Zorak's
nolife slot, and the 3 nolife slots 'below' Zorak.
(You have to use the lowercase version of someone's name,
 such as 'zorak' and not 'Zorak', or else it will not
 work properly.)


At the bottom after the listing, various things are listed
as follows:

Total Time:
   This is the total time spent online by all the people on
    the nolife list and is calculated periodically.

Fictional Earnings:
   The earnings that the mud would make if they charged
    for connection fees.  First is how much money per
    month, and the second is if they charged however
    much per hour.

Mean Time:
   This is the average time spent online for each player
    on the nolife list for the nolife period.

Total Active Players:
   This shows the number of players that are on the nolife
    list (basically, how many have logged on within the
    period of the past two weeks).

Avg non-idle players:
   This is the average number of active players that have been on
    at the same time within the nolife period.


Once again, the nolife period is the past two weeks.

Users that have not logged on and logged off in the nolife
period of two weeks will not be included in any of these
calculations on the nolife list.

  >>> NOTE: This line is to be used for OMP Discussion ONLY <<<

What is an OMP?
Beginning in 1998, The Marble Group (3K's parent company) has organized an
'Official MUD Party' that is open to all denizens of 3Kingdoms, their families
and friends.  These (mostly annual) OMPs are held in major cities around the
continental United States at a specific venue, typically a large hotel.  The
OMP is a multi-day event, with various activities that occur from Thursday
through Saturday.  Technically, Saturday evening/night is the actual OMP
event, which includes organized snacks, prizes and all sorts of cool stuff.

Why go to an OMP?
An OMP gives players from all over the world the chance to come together and
meet others who play 3K.  It is a chance to sit down and talk to people you
might never have met otherwise, and also a chance to hang with friends you see
year after year.  The weekend is packed with gatherings, movies, games,
parties and site-specific activities for all.

Is this an adults-only gathering?
Yes, yes and yes.  You must be 21 years or older to ride this ride.

Where can I find out more information on the next OMP?
Simply type 'omp' to see the latest details on any upcoming OMPs
Also check out the OMP room (type 'omp' at COT) and board for the latest info.


--------------------
file: /cmds/mortal/ompvoucher.c
The ompvoucher is full of all sorts of wondorous and useful powers ranging
from handy utility to that of seething, raw awesomeness.  The usage of this
unique package can only be gained on the very day of an OMP.  When the day of
the OMP approaches, you will be instructed as to how you can get access
yourself.

You don't have them yet, but the initial voucher benefits are listed below.
Once you acquire an OMP voucher (by attending an OMP or purchasing one the
day of an OMP), simply type 'ompvoucher' and you will be ready to roll.

file: /cmds/mortal/pabvote.c
keywords: mortal, pab
short: Vote for Player Advisory Board
header: Command: pabvote

     Syntax:  pabvote <who>

The pabvote command will allow you to cast a vote for another player to
join the Player Advisory Board. Each physical human player may cast one
vote. You may not vote for yourself. Votes are tracked by the user ID
so if a player has multiple alts, votes for *any* of their characters
will be counted together for that user. For example, if the real life
person, Bob, has three characters, Winkum (main), Blinkum (alt), and Nod
(alt), and the players cast 3 votes for Winkum, 2 for Blinkum, and none
for Nod, the system will tally that as 5 votes for Winkum (as that is
Bob's main).

Once voting has ended, the wizards will view the results and the top two
(2) winners, subject to veto by the Archons, will be appointed to their
roles along with one (1) picked by the Solar staff, and one (1) picked
by the Archons. The term shall last for one (1) year. If a board member
elects to step down or refuses to serve, the next person on the voting
list shall be chosen, as the list is retained until the next vote.

Anyone caught trying to circumvent the system to vote more than once by
any means will be wiped. No questions asked. So don't even think about
trying to 'test' it.

the same room as you.  Pretitles are limited to 15 characters or less.
 
If you're not looking to have any fun at all, and you don't want to let
occasional environmental factors change your pretitle for you, you can
use pretitle LOCK which toggles locking it down to only be changeable
by you and you alone.  But what fun is that?
 
And lets keep it clean folks.  If a wizard sees you with an obscene
pretitle he/she is well within their rights to snuf you on the spot.
Despite what you may think, some people are sensitive to that sort of
thing so keep it to yourself.  Also, ANSI is also not allowed 
nor are special characters.

file: /cmds/mortal/rating.c
keywords: mortal, areas, wizard, miscellaneous
aliases: 
short:  Will I die here??
header: Topic: Rating

  SYNTAX: rating [autorating off/on]

The 'rating' command will give you an area rating based upon
a general minimum recommended level for an area, and your player
level.  Please note that two players of different levels, standing
in the same room, will receive a different rating for that area.
This command gives you the area name, a rough idea of the levels
it was targetted to, and a class range of monsters found in the
area.  Furthermore, with the 'rating' vaf perk it will also show
how many rooms have been discovered in the area, whether or not the
room you're standing in normally starts with a monster, and
if you can acquire a unique item in this room.
The 'rating' command is usually a manual command, to be entered by
you when curious about an area.  However, new characters start in
a mode called 'autorating' where you will see the rating screen any
time you move from one wizard's area to another.  You can turn this
off (or back on again) using 'rating autorating off'

NOTE:

  The area rating is not a guarantee to avoid death.  As with all
  exploring, there are risks involved.  The rating system should
  ONLY be used as a guide, to help give you an estimate whether
  the area may be too difficult to fight in at your level.  Guild
  powers and levels are not factored into the rating system.

WARNING

  Please use extreme caution when exploring.  You will NOT be
  reimbursed for any deaths caused due to lack of understanding
  the information provided by the rating system.  You have been
  warned.

file: /cmds/mortal/reboot.c
keywords: mortal, reboot, time, mudlag, miscellaneous
aliases: 
short:  How long has the mud been up / When is reboot
header: Topic: Uptime

  SYNTAX:  uptime [#]

The 'uptime' command will provide you some information on the status of
the mud as far as player statistics are concerned.

The uptime command tells you:

    1) How long the mud has been up this current reboot
    2) When the next reboot is (modified for your timezone)
    3) The length of the next reboot
    4) Other crap

Feel free to use 'uptime2' for a quick, condensed version of the data

file: /cmds/mortal/redo.c
keywords: mortal, history, communication
aliases: 
short: Redo - Redirect a typoed line
header: Command: Redo
syntax: redo <wrongcmd> <newcmd>

Occasionally, a player will mistype the verb when typing out
a nice long chat. Needless to say, it's a pain in the neck to
go ahead and retype the whole thing. This command exists for
just such situations.  If you mistype a command or chatline you can
use this command to redo the command without retyping the entire thing.
To do so just type 'redo <oldcmd> <rightcmd>' and it will reissue
the last command that matches 'oldcmd' but as the new right command.
e.g.  shouut What guild should I join?
      redo shouut shout
That will change your typoed 'shouut' to 'shout'.

    reflex combat [on | off]               -Toggles combat only mode.

E.G.     reflex add hp 50% say Ack, only half HP left!
         reflex add hp <50% tell kikipopo I'm dying you smeghead!
         reflex remove sp 350

keywords: mortal, basic, miscellaneous, panic, reflex
aliases:

header: Topic: Repeat

  SYNTAX: repeat <when>/<action>/[dur]/[phase]/[notify]

The 'repeat' command allows you to set up an action to occur every
round, every combat round, and/or every non-combat round.
The following options are available:
 action : what command you would like to repeat
 when   : 'always', 'combat', or 'nocombat'
 dur    : for how many rounds, 0 means forever
 phase  : 0 = at the beginning of your round
          1 = at the end of your round
          2 = between your guild's automations but before attacking
          3 = between your guild's automations but after your attacks
          (you will want to tweak this depending on how your guild reacts)
 notify : A message you want displayed when it expires, only valid if
          you've provided a duration

Examples:
 Turn it off:
  repeat combat/off  -- off in combat
  repeat off  -- everything off

 In combat, always cast a spell after my guild has had its first chance to
 intercede in the round:
  repeat combat/cast death face at goblin/0/2

 I'm a cat...:
  repeat always/lick self/10/0/0/You are now clean.

file: /cmds/mortal/reps.c
keywords: mortal, reps, reputation
aliases: 
short: Shows a report of your characters reputations.
header: Topic: Reps

  Syntax: reps [-short] [-p:<who>] [<regexp>]

This command shows you your reputation with various factions in the
game.  Depending on how well liked or hated you are with a particular
group could impact your dealings with them.
The bar graph conveniently provided for you shows your progress within
a given faction.  Further to the left is nearing a more hostile status
while further to the right is nearing a friendlier status.

The '-short' argument will display the output without the graph section.
The '<regexp>' argument will only show factions that match the pattern.
The '-p:<who>' argument will display the reps for player <who>, if online.

Example:

 FACTION LIST :: Yournamehere

 Name                                 Reputation
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 fe dar Shad                          despised      |--*-----------------|
 Pinnacle Tower                       neutral       |----------*---------|

In this example you are despised with 'fe dar Shad' and closer to
being even more hated than you are to being more liked.  Similarly you
are smack dab in the middle of neutral for Pinnacle Tower.

Note: In many cases reputation is used as a point system or currency.  In
      these cases you can partake of your good favor to acquire items
      for free (no coin cost) or nearly free, this will reduce your 
      reputation based on the level of hospitality you've partaken.

file: /cmds/mortal/retrace.c
keywords: mortal, retrace, look
aliases: 
aliases: 
short: Retrace your path
header: Topic: Retrace

  SYNTAX:  retrace [fix/v]

This command lets you see which direction would most expeditiously
return you to the Center of Town.  This is based on the travels of
other players and is thus subject to the insanity of some players'
movements.  If you find yourself in a room you believe to be closer
to town than is suggested, just type 'retrace fix' and it should update.
This is not a guarantee and sometimes players will bollox things up with
teleportation style items and such, especially house portals.
Use your best judgement.  Management is not responsible for burtations.
Use with caution.  Etc...
The option 'v' will show you all exits and whether they are closer
or further.

file: /cmds/mortal/save.c
keywords: mortal, score, miscellaneous
aliases: 
short: How to have 'score' be there again for you when you relog
header: Topic: Save

  SYNTAX:  save

  The save command takes your stats (which include your strength,
dexterity, experience, age, quest info you used, etc.) and places
them all on the mud hard drive for future reference. This future
reference is usually when you log on again the next day.
  Fortunately for you, you are saved automaticly every 15 minutes,
when you quit and (unfortunately) when you die (no way to weasel out
of that unpleasant experience).

  For those who wonder why this command even exists. Well, if the mud was
pink and there were no wizzes or random force of nature then this command
would have been obsolete and I wouldn't have told you about all this.
  But life is not as such, and accidents (and "accidents") do happen that
cause the mud to crash unexpectingly causing all information of you
between the last save to the present moment to be completely lost and
there will be no proof that you actually did kill cancer.
  So sometimes it is wise to follow the advice I give when I start coding:
             "Save now, and save often!"

This wonderful command allows you to speak absolutely FREE! Not
a single spell point is lost. "How is this possible?" you might
ask (that's the first thing I asked when someone told me it's
possible). Well, there is a catch. 
The catch is that you can talk to only the people that are in the
same room with you.
"That's not too bad." you might say. There is also a second catch.
Second catch is that everyone that is in the room with you can hear
you too. So if you are in center of town, don't say things like
"I think *CENSORED*" because someone might hear you, and if you want
them to hear you, then you might as well use shout.

  Syntax:  sc | score | score2 | mudscore <arg>

The 'sc' command, short for the 'score' command will show you a
colorful report detailing your character's attributes and
accomplishments.  This includes your level, quest points, and
statistics, among other things.
The 'Quests :' display breaks down as follows:  Quests A(B/C/D)
  Where:  'A' = Total Quest Points
          'B' = Total in-game quests
          'C' = Marbles, OMP, or bonus quest points
          'D' = QP from quests no longer active

When you pass any <arg> to 'sc' or 'score', it will show just your
statistics on a single line.
If you use 'score stats' you will see a small, detailed display of your stats.

Many guilds add guild-specific character information to the score 
sheet, or have alternate score sheets listing other information.
Contact a specific guild's members for more information about
the workings of that particular guild. If you want to overrule
your guild's score command, type 'mudscore'.

Your resistances show a very general idea of how resistant you are to
the various damage types in the game.  The order of the types is as
follows: Edged (such as swords, daggers, stabby things), Blunt (such
as clubs, maces, thumpy things), Fire, Ice, Acid, Electricity, Mental,
Magical Energy, Poison, Radiation.

You can customize the colors with 'setcolor <var> <colour>', where
<color> is one of:

  sc_text     : The text, like 'Wimpy:' and 'Exp :'
  sc_value    : All values in the score list, like '13'.
  sc_title    : Your title.
  sc_warning  : Medium hps/sps, or when you're very drunk.
  sc_danger   : Low hps/sps, stat penalties, or when you're blind drunk.
  sc_bonus    : Extra hps/sps, stat bonus.

For example, 'setcolor sc_bonus yellow' will show any stat or hp/sp
bonuses in a yellow color.  Provided you have 'ansi on', of course. :)
When you haven't specified a color, score will use its own default
colors.

file: /cmds/mortal/scaler.c
Allows you to set the level that your scaling dungeons will apply
when you enter them.  The range is 75% of your level to your level+5

The scaling happens upon your very first entry into a new dungeon,
once set, the scaled level will not change until the dungeon is cleared
from your 'dungeons' list.
For example: Bob, the level 37 thief, is fighting in Puppymill.  All
the puppies are scaled to level 37 because he didn't set his scaler.
Bob sets his scaler to 29, because thieves are worse than gentech,
but his puppies will remain unchanged.  So Bob wanders over to Alphabet
land, which he hasn't been in yet, and it scales to 29.  Bob then
sets his scaler to 39 and heads to Death Taco, which will scale to
level 39.  Now, no matter what Bob does, his Death Taco is set to 39
his Alphabet to 29 and Puppymill to 37.  If Bob clears his dungeons
then when he re-enters, it will scale to his current scaler level

Typing 'scaler' with no argument will tell you what your current
scaler is set to and also the level of the dungeon you're currently in.
(This level shows up on the 'dungeons' command as well.)

aliases: 
short: How to find king solomons lost treasure
header: Command: Search
::::::::::::::::::::::
    Topic: search
::::::::::::::::::::::

  Syntax:  search
   OR:   search <item>

You are in a mysterious room and you have a gut feeling that there is
more here than meets the eye. So to confirm or disperse your suspecions
you search.
If you do it in the general form 'search' then in other words, you look
around aimlessly, giving each item in the room a little attention, hoping
that something will jump up and grab your ass.
If you choose a more specific form (i.e.: 'search table') then you give
the table your utmost attention trying to find the thinnest of clues
(this search sometimes end up with an anal probe).

If your treasure.gemology skill is trained you will be able to
occasionally find gems in otherwise empty rooms.  Sure, it
might be tedious to search every room you come to, but for the
chance at that rare diamond, isn't it worth it?
Note: If a gem is not found on the first search by the first person
      with gemology, that means no gem exists in that room. (for anyone)

keywords: mortal, ansi, color, mudansi, aset, acopy, ansivars

short: Ansi setup.
header: Command: Setcolor
::::::::::::::::::::::
    Topic: Setcolor
::::::::::::::::::::::

  Syntax:  setcolor <variable> : Clears the value of a variable.
           setcolor <variable> <colour> : Sets the value to a variable.
           setcolor <variable> full     : Configures the variable to always
                                          use full-line ansi colour.
           setcolor <variable> part     : Configures the variable to always
                                          use partial-line ansi colour.
           setcolor <variable> default  : Configures the variable to use your
                                          default full/partial preference.
           setcolor                     : Shows all your variables and
                                          their colour.
           setcolor -check              : Shows a nicer listing of all your
                                          variables and their colours.

You may, for instance, set your tell to green by typing 'setcolor tell green'.
You may also do 'setcolor tell green+flash' which will give you a green
flashing tell.  Setcolor also allows you to define the colours you will see for
items (eg. 'set armour red').
Additionally, you can set a variable to 'hide' if you never want to see
it again (mud-side gag), please keep in mind, if you hide a line or
text, and then forget about it and go to a wizard begging for help on why
you no longer can receive tells, we will mock you mercilessly.
example: aset auction hide
         (Now you will never see an auction line chat again until you
          set it to something other than 'hide')

The 'full' and 'part' args allow you to configure a specific variable to
always use full- or partial-line colouring, which override the default
(global) setting that you configure with 'ansi full' or 'ansi part'.
The 'default' option reverses that.

file: /cmds/mortal/setmod.c

  SYNTAX: setmod <property> <value>
          setmod ROWS 35
          setmod COLS 75
          setmod TIMEZONE 4
          setmod TERMCAP CLEAR
          setmod TELLSELF CLEAR
          setmod SCREENREAD 1

    The setmod command allows you to configure the options found
    in the Modifications Office from anywhere on the mud.

    Note: You can clear (turn off) an option by typing:
              setmod <property> CLEAR

  OPTIONS:
    ROWS - This property sets the number of vertical rows your
      terminal supports.  For example, if you can fit 35 lines
      of text on your screen without it scrolling off the top
      you would have 35 vertical rows.  This property is most
      useful in setting the page breaks when you are in a 'MORE'
      prompt.

    COLS - Set the number of columns your terminal should wrap
           text to.  The mud default is 72. (not widely used)

    TERMCAP - This will set your terminal emulation property.
      This can help ansi emulation and some extra features used
      in some code, such as screen clearing and cursor movement.
      Currently, only 2 termcaps are supported: vt100 and vt52.

    TIMEZONE - This property will set the time zone you live in.
      Setting your time zone will show your current local time in
      the 'time' command, as well as the standard 3K time.
      You can figure your time zone by calculating the number of
      hours difference between your time zone and Greenwich Mean
      Time (GMT).  Normally, 3K's time zone is GMT-5 (i.e. 5 hours
      earlier than GMT), but it switches to GMT-4 during daylight
      savings in North America.  If your time zone isn't a whole-
      number of hours different to GMT (e.g. say you're GMT + 9.5
      hours), then you can set the minutes as well by placing a colon
      between the hours and minutes, for example:
      setmod TIMEZONE 9:30

    TELLSELF - When the TELLSELF property is set, all of your
      outgoing tells will be logged to your tellhist along with
      the normal incoming tells.  This is extremely handy when
      keeping up with multiple conversations.
      Example tellhist:
      To: Leila : What's up?
      Tulip : Got a sec?
      Leila : Nothing much, just catching up on boards.
      To: Tulip : Sure, shoot.
      To: Leila : Fun fun fun.

    SCREENREAD - When the SCREENREAD property is set, the MUD
      will alter some output to be easier for a screen reader
      to process. This is not automatic and each individual
      location where it occurs must be coded manually so it
      is an ongoing process. If you come across something that
      would display better for a screen reader and isn't, please
      mail SCREENREADER with as much detail as you can (which 
      command, if its a guild command then which guild, 
      suggestions for how it could output, etc.)

::::::::::::::::::::::
    Topic: shout
::::::::::::::::::::::

  Syntax:  shout <message>

When you logged on, most probably it wouldn't have been two minutes
before you see 'thisplayer shouts: thisguild babes rocks the mud!!!'.
Yes, you have guessed correctly, thisplayer has used the 'shout' command.
The shout command allows you to broadcast your views, opinions and
mindless babble to every single person on the mud.
Naturally on a command as powerful as this there are a few limitations:
1. It isn't heard by anyone who is earmuffed or shoutblocks you.
2. There is a limit on how much spam you can send and you know you reached
   your limit when you see the words 'yadda yadda yadda' appear.
3. You can shout only once a minute.
4. This is not the auction line.  Do not use it as such.

Please note: We consider shouting a privilege here on 3k; it is a privilege
that can be taken away from you in one of several ways if it is abused.  It is
the sole discretion of the higher 3k administration as your access to this
privilege.

Type 'help vaf' to learn more about how to...
 * Double your shout length before 'yadda yadda' kicks in ('vaf yadda')
 * Remove your personal shout delay time ('vaf stimer')
 * Increase your earmuffs to block other people shouting ('vaf muffs1')

/=========================================================================\
Command:            shoutblock
Purpose:            Allows you to block shouts from specific players.
Syntax:             shoutblock; shoutblock <who>; shoutblock clear

Amount:             You may shoutblock 5 people maximum.
Argument Details:   Without arguments, shoutblock returns a list of who you
                    are blocking.  Giving the name of a player will toggle
                    that player's status within your list - either add or
                    remove him or her. You may give multiple names, eg:
                    shoutblock name1 name2 name3 name4 name4
                    shoutblock clear will clear your list.
                    shoutblocks are not currently saved.
Currently Blocking: Nobody.
Disclaimer:         You have the right to shoutblock wizards below the rank
                    of Admin, but YOU are responsible for any warnings
                    issued by wizards that you miss while shoutblocking.
                    e.g. If you shoutblock a Lord, and he shouts a 
                    warning that it is unsafe to enter a certain area, 
                    if you do enter that area and die, you will have no

  SYNTAX: spawnsecond toggle     - toggles your chars' visiblity in finger info

Legally spawns an additional character, linking it to your other character(s).
All your current characters must be at least level 50 to do this.  If you don't

out 'help vaf' and 'vaf list xchar' to see how to gain another.

        * * * * * READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY * * * * *

1) Be logged in with your 'main' char (probably the one you're using now)
2) Create (and login) your new character (example: Bob)
3) With both logged in, on your main character, type 'spawnsecond bob'
   (well, not 'bob' but the name of your new character, of course)
4) Logout one of your characters
5) Play on!

With regards to 'spawnsecond toggle,' every character starts out by default
as "not shown".  If you keep it this way, not showing a character, for
instance, "Bob," Bob will not show anyone linked to him in his finger info,
nor will Bob appear in any of your other characters' finger infos.  If you
choose to show Bob, he will appear in all of your other character's finger
infos, except for those that are not themselves being shown.  As an example,
Bob, Steve and Pete are your chars.  You show Bob and Steve.  Finger either
Bob or Steve and you see both in each other's finger info, but Pete is not
shown in either.  Finger Pete and you won't see anyone else in his finger
info either.  Clear as mud?  Great, you'll figure it out.  Also, you can only
toggle a character's showing from that character, while they are logged in.

file: /cmds/mortal/tell.c
keywords: mortal, tellhist, tellb, communication, say, whisper, shout, gossip
aliases: 
short: Talking to your friends from afar
header: Topic: Tell

  Syntax: tell <player> <message>

The 'ask' and 'tell' commands are identical, but are both installed
for your grammatical convenience.

These commands let you send a message to a single player on the mud,
whether they are in the room or not.

There is no cost for this.  To reply automatically to the last person
who 'told' you something, use the 'reply' or 'respond' command.

Note: Tells will reach a person, even if they are in a different realm
To send a tell to a person in a specific realm, use the @ symbol.
For example: 'tell barnaby@3k2 hey there'

You cannot tell to anybody that is tellblocking you.

file: /cmds/mortal/tellb.c
keywords: mortal, tell, tellhist, communication, shoutblock, trs
aliases: 
short:  Tellblock a certain person's annoying tells
header: Topic: Tellb

  SYNTAX: tellb OR tellb <player name>

The 'tellb' command will allow you to block the incoming tells
from someone you want absolutely nothing to do with.

With no argument, the command will list all the people you are
tellblocking.  With the argument as a player's name, you will
tellblock that person.  Typing 'tellb <that person>' again will
remove them from the tellblock list.

Type 'help vaf' to learn more about how to tellblock all at once.

header: Topic: Tellhist
syntax: tellhist

The 'tellhist' command is a very handy device.  This command
will show you the last 16 things that people have told to you,
just in case you missed in the scroll.

  'tellhist' will return your latest tells, up to 16
  'tellhist #' will return your latest # tells

enough information so that the wizard can figure out what the 
typo is.

PLEASE NOTE:
  If you are reporting a typo regarding an item, a colon must 
  be placed after the item you are reporting.

You may choose to use the 'unkeep all' option to mark all items for
unkeeping. You can also 'unkeep all equip', which will mark all
kept worn armours as well as your wielded weapon as unkept.

You may also 'unkeep all bound' to unkeep all kept equipment that is
currently bound to you.

file: /cmds/mortal/vaf.c
keywords:
aliases: funds, vafs
short: Voluntary Access Fees (VAFs)
We humbly request Voluntary Access Fees (VAFs) from any of our players willing
to pay them, with each $1 getting you 1 VAF credit.  You are not required to pay
a VAF to play 3Kingdoms (hence the 'voluntary' part), but without them to take
care of operating costs, 3K can't exist to be played, so you can do the math. 
We rely on the generosity of the player community, players like you, to keep
3Kingdoms running for the good of everyone.  It's kind of like PBS, but with
monsters.  As a bonus for VAFs given, you are afforded a number of choice
rewards that are listed at the bottom.  Once you are credited with your VAFs,
you can then spend the credits in the Vault of Ancient Fables, which you can
reach by 'kneel'ing at the Center of Town.  There, the Guardian Atriel will
assist you in your selections.  If you have multiple characters, any VAFs given
will be applied to the group, meaning that any of your characters will then be
able to spend from your shared VAF pool.  Basically, your VAFs are tied to the
human controlling the characters, rather than a specific character.  Once you
spend a VAF on an enhancement, however, that enhancement is tied to that
character alone (with some noted exceptions).  VAFs are not transferrable
between players (humans), and if all characters are wiped for whatever reason,
all VAFs attributed to that character/set of characters are wiped also.

To pay online, use the below link.  Your credits will appear within 24 hours,
but usually much sooner than that.  For any issues, "mail VAFS" for support.

 Go to http://www.3k.org and then click the Gold 3K VAF icon

Be sure to include '3K' and your character's name in the notes.
(e.g. '3K Barnaby').  Only VAF in whole dollars, as rogue cents will be
truncated.  You can check your VAF status at any time by using the 'vaf'
command.  You can also learn more details about the individual enhancements
below by typing 'vaf <enhancement>'

All players and wizards alike are reported, though some have the ability
to hide themselves from visibility on the who list.  Linkdead players are
visible on the list until 2 hours or more linkdead, at which point they are
considered 'Ethereal' and are not listed individually.  Linkdead players
(ethereal or not) are still able to receive tells, in which case they will
be notified upon their return.

short:  Show a list of the players currently on the mud

      OR:  who2 age
 
A tabulated who list.  With no argument, it will list the players

file: /cmds/mortal/wimpy.c
keywords: mortal, combat, kill
aliases: 
short:  When will you automatically run from a fight?
header: Topic: Wimpy

  SYNTAX:  wimpy <number>

The number in the above syntax corresponds to the percentage of
your maximum hit points that, once your hit points drop below
in the course of battle, will cause you to automatically flee.

For example: Assume your maximum # of hit points is 100.
             If you type 'wimpy 20' then your wimpy will
             be set to 20% of 100 hit points.
             In this example, you will then run away at
             20 hit points (or less).
 
Default for a new player is brave mode (0%).

Wimpy is no secure thing.  It might save you, if you have a slow
connection or slow fingers, but remember, some monsters can hack
a lot of hit points from you in one blow and some monsters can
run as fast as you can.


--------------------

make sure this is set properly for each fight, or not set at all
so that a random direction will be chosen.
The effectiveness of this setting is directly linked to your sharpness
skill.  You should read up on that.
If the direction you choose does not exist, or your skill level fails
its chance to fire, a random exit will be chosen if one exists.

file: /cmds/mortal/wizardling.c
keywords: characters, wizard, infinity, build
aliases: 
short: Wizardling
header: Topic: Creating a Wizardling

  SYNTAX: wizardling [charname] - links up [charname] to your main character
          no argument will toggle your location between town/your area


This command allows you to link a new (non-second) character to you so
that you can create infinity areas without being restricted or penalized
for having two characters on at once.  If you should choose to wiz
then at that time the normal wizard rules about multiplaying would apply.
This new character, your wizardling, exists separately from your character
list and is only identified by its title to be related to you.  This
character will only have access to rooms in town, rooms in infinity,
and rooms that may have made it in game under your name.

In short: This is designed to create a character for you that's sole purpose
is to create new content and/or pursue being a wizard.
To use this, create a new character and type 'wizardling <newchar>' to link
it to your name.

Just typing 'wizardling' with no argument will teleport your wizardling
character to town from your area, or to your area from town.

When you want your area linked into the infinity realm, be it immediately
or after you've built it, just ask a titled wizard to create the entrance
for you from The Beginning of Infinity in whatever direction you choose.

file: /cmds/himort/badditem.c
Did you forget an additem again?  Don't feel like editing the file and
searching for where it goes?  Then remembering the syntax?  Do you
mostly just hate life?  Yea, me too.  Now you can use this command
to add NEW add_items to the room you're in.  Simply type:

   badditem [-s] <comma separated list of items>

And then you'll be prompted for the item description, and blammo, you
have yourself a fancy new add_item() in your room.  Check it out.
You can use the '-s' flag to add a search item instead.

Used without an argument, it will list all additems in the room.

Surgeon General's Warning: Use of this function may cause unexpected
                           appearances of Rumor behind you, naked.

Example: badditem tree,trees,green trees
         These are lush green trees, with many leaves.

         badditem -s leaves
         As you search the leaves you discover they are covered in bugs!

Caveats: Early add-items will trump later add items, that means if you
         typo'd a description, it will be forever typo'd until a wizard
         intervenes.  (You can short-term fix it with this command, but
         as soon as the room unloads, it will revert.)

--------------------
file: /cmds/himort/bdelete.c
This command will delete an exit or collection of add items that have
been added to a room you created via the 'build' command.  To delete
an exit, please type: bdelete exit/<direction to delete>
To delete an item use: bdelete item/<name of item>

Please note: Deleting an item will delete ALL of the items that
             are associated with that item as well.

Example: build east roomxyz
 (oops): west (to get back) bdelete exit/east

         badditem lights,camera,action
         You see lights, a camera, and some action.
 (oops): bdelete item/camera   (removes all 3 since they point at one desc)

When deleting exits, if you want both sides deleted, you need to do each
one separately.
You can use this to make a room dark, or light again too.
Use 'bdelete light/light' to toggle between light and dark.

--------------------
file: /cmds/himort/bdescr.c
This command aids a high mortal in developing his/her area by allowing a
quick and easy way to provide a short and long description to your room.

Syntax:  bdescr [-s] [text]
         bdescr SAVE

With no arguments the 'bdescr' command will show the current short and
long description of the room and the source of those values.
When you're done burning through your area in this manner, you can use
the SAVE directive to merge the short and long descriptions back into
the room's '.c' file permanently.

Example:  bdescr -s My Room
          bdescr You are standing in my room.  Please leave.
  (oops)  bdescr You are standing in my room.  Get naked.
          bdescr SAVE   (not necessarily required, but no going back now)
                        (makes your directory cleaner and prevents you from
                         making further changes without wiz interaction.
                         Necessary before your area becomes public domain.)

--------------------
file: /cmds/himort/bmob.c
In conjuction with the 'build' command and related utilities, this command
allows you to add a monster to your room.  It adds the most basic of
monsters with your fully fleshed out descriptions and a full set of
comments on how you want a WIZARD to finish coding it.  You cannot
add more than one monster per room.

A monster needs a file name, a name, a short description, a long
description, a set of aliases, and commentary.  So, make sure you
have that information ready before you start this command.  It will run
you through many prompts to get this information.

Further information:
file name : your unique filename, no player sees it
name : What you'd see in combat, such as 'red dragon', 'jake' etc
short: What you see in the room, such as 'a large red dragon'
long: The full description you'd see when examining the monster
aliases: any of the other words a player could look at to see your mob
comments: Anything/everything necessary to turn this monster into what
          you want it to be.  'class 50k, aggro, summons rats...'
          (This should be a terse but concise list, as exampled above.)

--------------------
file: /cmds/himort/build.c
Well, you've done it.  You've discovered the secret to unbridled
area creation power.

Using this command you can build rooms on the fly, as you wander around.
Need to wander around your area a bit before you find a suitable place
to expand it?  Want to just make a whole new area without having to edit
dozens of files by hand?  Well, this is your ticket.


 Syntax: build <dir> <filename>
         build list  (show all my files)
         build  (show syntax plus which room I'm in now)

 Creates a new room in direction 'dir' from the room you're in now.
 It creates the exits in your source room and destination room and
 gives the new room a filename that's cartesionly coordinated from
 the one you're in now.  Or named 'filename' if you provide it.
 A named 'file' is just a filename, no path, no ., space, /, \
 (Valid dirs: the 8 cardinal, in/out, up/down, enter/exit, portal)
 Dual-direction hidden exits can be made with a preceding '@' character.
 Single (exiting) hidden exits can be made with a preceding '#' character.
 Single (return) hidden exits can be made with a preceding '$' character.

 example: build west street_corner
          build @north back_hidden_room   (hidden in both ways)
          build #north other_hidden_room  (hidden out of this room only)
          build $north third_hidden_room  (hidden only from the other side)
 Do not use special characters in the destination room except underscore.

Once in your new room you can use 'bdescr' and 'badditem' commands to
add real flavor to it.

CAREFUL: Random use of this command is going to add exits to the
room you are in!  Your area is automatically 'in game', so you will be
giving access to all players.  Be aware of this.
